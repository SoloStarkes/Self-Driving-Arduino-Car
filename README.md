# Self-Driving-Arduino-Car
Repaired a broken RC car and replaced it with an arduino and added an ultrasonic sensor mounted on some servo motors to give self driving capabilities.

• Built a broken remote-control car into a self-driving car that could sense its surroundings using servo motors and ultrasonic
sensors. This was done by soldering an ultrasonic sensor to a servo motor and making a 360-degree scan of its environment to do
so. An Arduino was also mounted on to the car, so that this process could be self-sufficient.
• Developed soldering skills that stimulated growth in dexterity and designed code to program the car using C++
